                <p class="description">&#9432; MobileNet got combination lock, but with only 30% confidence, meaning that Google Lens beat it.</p>

                <p class="description">&#9432; MobileNet was close to getting this right. It guessed a Spotlight, which looks similar to the microscope. But it won't get any points for that.</p>

                <p class="description">&#9432; Both Google Lens and MobileNet got this one correct. But the only difference is that Google Lens thought the phone was a phone case, but MobileNet thought it was a computer. Both of them get a point for that.</p>

            <h1 class="winner" style="color: white; font-weight: 100">Final Conclusion: <br>On the basis of my tests, and data collected by many others, Google Lens turns out to be the more accurate image identification platform (as expected). Google Lens was able to identify every single one of the images shown to it accurately, whereas, MobileNet was unable to detected 80-90% of all images shown to it accurately, or confidentally (with a confidence less than 25% every single time). Google Lens is also capable of accurately identifying animals, and plants, giving you specifications about it, while MobileNet is barely able to provide you with the correct object. <b>Google Lens has proven to be the superior image identification platform!</b></h1>
